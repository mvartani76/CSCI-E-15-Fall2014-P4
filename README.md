## Financial Valuation Web Application
### DWA Project 4 - Mike Vartanian

## Live URL:
<http://p4.mikevartanian.me/>

## Description
I do quite a bit of valuation of projects and companies in one of my roles in the M&A group at the company I work for.
The current method of doing this involves very complicated Excel spreadsheets and group collaboration is done through email with very little tracking of changes.

The goal for this project is to emulate what is done using these spreadsheets and potentially augment the functionality using a web application. The scope of this project, however, will be to set up a basic framework for this site due to time constraints and limits of what I actually know how to do at this time... :)


## Demo

As a remote student, my demo is located in jing at the following location (TBD).

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
